# Semantic Versioning

The AVD project follows Semantic Versioning ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)).

This document describes which attributes and APIs are stable and follow SemVer and which ones may change between minor releases.

## Ansible Collection (arista.avd)

All roles input variables follow SemVer. Any breaking changes will, at a minimum, be communicated with a deprecation notice in the previous release, except for the ones resulting from a bug fix that will be documented in the release notes. Keys will then be documented as removed in the next major release.

### Roles

| Roles | Inputs Follow SemVer | Outputs Follow SemVer | Notes |
| ----- | :------------------: | :-------------------: | ----- |
| `eos_designs` + `eos_cli_config_gen`<br>EOS CLI configuration | ✅ | ✅ | When leveraging `eos_designs` with `eos_cli_config_gen`, the resulting EOS CLI configuration generated from `eos_cli_config_gen` will be maintained, unless in rare cases when addressing a bug. |
| `eos_designs`<br>Structured configuration | ✅ | ✘ | eos_designs `structured_configuration` may change between minor releases.<br>Structured configuration can change to use new keys when keys are deprecated in the `eos_cli_config_gen` role. |
| `eos_designs`<br>Documentation | ✅ | ✘ | Fabric documentation artifacts may change between minor releases.<br>Breaking changes to CSV output will be communicated in the release notes. |
| `eos_designs`<br>`avd_switch_facts` or `switch.*` | ✅ | ✘ | The `switch.*` and `avd_switch_facts` are internal datamodels used for sharing data between various stages of `eos_designs`. They **should not** be used in custom templates for interface descriptions or IP addressing, since they are subject to change without notice. |
| `eos_cli_config_gen`<br>EOS configuration | ✅ | ✅ | EOS configuration generated by `eos_cli_config_gen` follows SemVer.<br>Breaking changes may occur in rare cases when addressing a bug.<br>Reordering of the CLI output may occur but without impacting the resulting configuration on EOS. |
| `eos_cli_config_gen`<br>Documentation | ✅ | ✘ | Device documentation artifacts may change during minor releases.|
| `cvp_configlet_upload` | ✅ | ✅ | |
| `eos_config_deploy_cvp` | ✅ | ✘ | Structured configuration output may change during minor releases to accommodate changes in the ansible-cvp collection. <br>The resulting CloudVision configuration will be maintained, unless in rare cases, when addressing a bug.<br>Breaking changes will be communicated in the release notes. |
| `cv_deploy` | ✅ | ✅ | The resulting CloudVision configuration will be maintained, unless in rare cases, when addressing a bug. |
| `eos_config_deploy_eapi` | ✅ | ✅ | |
| `eos_validate_state` | ✅ | ✘ | The generated reports and other artifacts may change between minor releases.<br>Breaking changes to CSV outputs will be communicated in the release notes.|
| `dhcp_provisioner` | ✅ | ✘ | Structured configuration output may change during minor releases to accommodate changes in the ansible-cvp collection.<br>The resulting DHCP configuration will be maintained, unless in rare cases, when addressing a bug. |
| `build_output_folders` | ✅ | ✅ | |

## PyAVD

All functions input variables follow SemVer. Any breaking changes will, at a minimum, be communicated with a deprecation notice in the previous release, except for the ones resulting from a bug fix that will be documented in the release notes. Keys will then be documented as removed in the next major release.

!!! warning

    Internal/undocumented code is not covered by SemVer. Changes may not be documented in release notes.
